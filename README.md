# BridgeQL


`bridgeql` is part of VMware's support for open source development
and community.

A library which will add feature to serve your model over rest API
* This will allow users to make ORM query based on any models present in the django app
* This will ask user to provide request in defined format and will serve the API response as json data
* This will allow users to make filter, selection, ordering, slicing and count of model objects

## Usage

The bridgeql library can be integrated to the Django app by editing settings
file by including `bridgeql` in the `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` variable.
Another change required is to add a url to your existing project as

```
    projectname/projectname/settings.py
```

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'bridgeql'
    ...
    ]

```

On your project you can edit `urls.py`, to include the `bridgeql` urls.

```python
from bridgeql import urls as bridgeql_urls
...

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('bridgeql/', include(bridgeql_urls)),
    ...
]
...
```
This way your app will be ready to serve the REST API to expose model query, you can request an API like follows:
```python
    params = {
       'using': 'db1',
       'app_name': 'machine',
       'model_name': 'Machine',
       'filter': {
           'os__name': 'os-name-1'
        },
        'fields': ['ip', 'name', 'id'],
        'exclude': {
           'name': 'machine-name-11'
        },
        'order_by': ['ip'],
        'limit': 5,
        'offset': 10,
    }
    resp = make_post_api_call(api_url, {'payload': json.dumps(params))
    result = resp.json()
```

The above parameters will translate into running the model query for `Machine` model of `machine` django app.

```python
Machine.objects.using('db1')
                .filter(os__name = 'os-name-1')
                .exclude(name = 'machine-name-11')
                .values(['ip', 'name', 'id'])
                .order_by('ip')[10:15] # offset: offset + limit
```


## Management Commands

`bridgeql` includes few management commands (`bridgeql` needs to be added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` to add these commands):

```python
python manage.py create_test_data # for testing purpose we can create some test data
python manage.py dumpdata --indent 2 > machine_tests.json # to create test fixtures
```


### Build & Run

1. make test
2. source venv/bin/activate && tox
3. python -m pip install --upgrade build
4. python -m build
